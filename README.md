A simple player management system created as a training exercise in just a few hours. The project is inspired by the fictional team "Ebony Dragons," whose lore was generated by an AI. The name "Drakkar" references the dragon theme of the team.

The concepts of DDD were followed, with division into application (main), repositories (infrastructure/persistence), and domain (application logic). In addition to some design patterns and clean code practices.
